\section*{Introduction and Outline of Project}
A botnet (the combination of the words robot and network) is a group of network
enabled malware infected. Bots, the infected devices, are controlled by a central
server or servers, often called the “bot-herder” or the “command and control server”.
A botnet can be used for a wide variety of malicious activities. From DDoS to data
theft, botnets can interfere with computer information systems in a variety of ways
and are worthy of studying and considering mitigation techniques.

    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Taxonomy of Botnets}
Botnets can be constructed in a number of 
ways and fulfill many different purposes for an attacker. 
They can either be centralized, using a client-server model, or decentralized, 
using a peer-to-peer model. 
\subsection*{Attack Vectors}
Botnets exploit various attack vectors to infect devices 
and expand their network. The most common methods that botnets 
use are exploiting vulnerabilities, phishing, worm-like propagation, 
and using external devices. Botnets exploit vulnerabilities such as 
unpatched software, misconfigurations, and security loopholes 
found within operating systems, applications, or IoT devices. 
\subsection*{Mitigation Techniques}
There any a myriad of different techniques that try to mitigate the damage
caused by botnets, or limit their spread altogether. We would like to focus
on a few different techniques: firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and
challenge response tests. 
\subsection*{Experimentation}
We first plan to look into existing 
botnet frameworks to examine their methods and features. 
After research into frameworks, we plan to build a simulated botnet, 
with various bot devices running in containers. 
Using a modularized approach we can change the purpose of the botnet 
dynamically to explore the differences. We plan to compare botnet 
communication and architecture methods by running a set of tasks 
for the different methods. If time permits we plan on testing different 
mitigation techniques.
\subsection*{Conclusion}
Our project will explore botnets in a variety of different contexts. 
We will attempt to approach the subject both from a research-based approach,
creating an overview of botnets as they relate to computer security,
and from an experimental approach by attempting to implement a basic version of
a botnet.
